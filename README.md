## My process

- Think about the layout, choices I should make when choosing HTML elements
- Think about the possible solutions to the layout
- Research Flexbox and Grid
- Decided to use Grid for Desktop layout, and Flexbox for the transition and mobile layout
- Started with Desktop; tried to match the layout as much as possible
  - Did the same for the font size as well, margins too
- When the overall layout was done, next step was to match the details
- Went back and forth between the design and my current status to match the details as much as possible

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use grid
- Better usage of custom properties
